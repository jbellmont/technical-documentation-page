        <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. 
          Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.</p>

        <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for 
          creating CSS layouts were things like floats and positioning. These are fine and 
          they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and frustrating.</p>
        <p>The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to 
          achieve with such tools, in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
          <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the 
            available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
          <li>Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same height 
            even if they contain a different amount of content.</li>
        </ul>

      <article>
        <p>To start with, we need to select which elements are to be laid out as flexible boxes. 
          To do this, we set a special value of display on the parent element of the elements you 
          want to affect. In this case we want to lay out the <b>article</b> elements, so we set this
          on the <b>section</b> (which becomes a flex container): </p>
        <code>section { <br>
              display: flex; <br>
        }</code>
      </article>
    </section>

      <article>
        <p>When elements are laid out as flexible boxes, they are laid out along two axes:</p>
        <img src="img/flex-axes.png" alt="Flexbox axes: main axis and cross axis">
        <ul>
          <li>The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are 
            being laid out in (e.g. as rows across the page, or columns down the page.) 
            The start and end of this axis are called the main start and main end.</li>
          <li>The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the 
            flex items are being laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called 
            the cross start and cross end.</li>
          <li>The parent element that has display: flex set on it (the <b>section</b> in 
            our example) is called the flex container.</li>
          <li>The items being laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are 
            called flex items (the <b>article</b> elements in our example).</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="Columns_or_rows">

      <article>
        <p>Flexbox provides a property called flex-direction that specifies what direction 
          the main axis runs in (what direction the flexbox children are laid out in) — 
          by default this is set to row, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the 
          direction your browser's default language works in (left to right, in the case of
           an English browser).</p>
        <p>Try adding the following declaration to your <b>section</b> rule:</p>
        <code>flex-direction: column;</code>
        <p>You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much like they 
          were before we added any CSS. Before you move on, delete this declaration from 
          your example.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Wrapping">
      <header><h1>Wrapping</h1><hr></header>
      <article>
        <p>One issue that arises when you have a fixed amount of width or height in your 
          layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, 
          breaking the layout. Have a look at our flexbox-wrap0.html example, and try viewing 
          it live (take a local copy of this file now if you want to follow along with this example):
        </p>
        <img src="img/flex-wrap-bad.png" alt="Example of poor wrapping of flex items">
        <p>Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their container. One way in which you 
          can fix this is to add the following declaration to your <b>section</b> rule:</p>
        <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code>
        <p>Also, add the following declaration to your <b>article</b> rule:</p>
        <code>flex: 200px;</code>
        <p>Try this now; you'll see that the layout looks much better with this included:</p>
        <img src="img/flex-wrap-good.png" alt="Example of good wrapping of flex items">
        <p>We now have multiple rows — as many flexbox children are fitted onto each row as 
          makes sense, and any overflow is moved down to the next line. The flex: 200px declaration 
          set on the articles means that each will be at least 200px wide; we'll discuss this property 
          in more detail later on. You might also notice that the last few children on the last row 
          are each made wider so that the entire row is still filled.</p>
        <p>But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your flex-direction 
          property value to row-reverse — now you'll see that you still have your multiple 
          row layout, but it starts from the opposite corner of the browser window and flows 
          in reverse.</p>
      </article>
    </section>   

    <section class="main-section" id="Flexible_sizing_of_items">
      <header><h1>Flexible sizing of items</h1><hr></header>
      <article>
        <p>Let's now return to our first example, and look at how we can control what 
          proportion of space flex items take up compared to the other flex items. 
          Fire up your local copy of flexbox0.html, or take a copy of flexbox1.html 
          as a new starting point (see it live).</p>
        <p>First, add the following rule to the bottom of your CSS:</p>
        <code>article { <br>
          flex: 1; <br>
        }</code>
        <p>This is a unitless proportion value that dictates how much of the available 
          space along the main axis each flex item will take up compared to other flex items.
          In this case, we are giving each <b>article</b> element the same value (a value of 1), 
          which means they will all take up an equal amount of the spare space left after 
          things like padding and margin have been set. It is relative to other flex items, 
          meaning that giving each flex item a value of 400000 would have exactly the same 
          effect.</p>
        <p>Now add the following rule below the previous one:</p>
        <code>article:nth-of-type(3) { <br>
          flex: 2; <br>
        }</code>
        <p>Now when you refresh, you'll see that the third <b>article</b> takes up twice 
          as much of the available width as the other two — there are now four proportion 
          units available in total (since 1 + 1 + 2 = 4). The first two flex items have 
          one unit each so they take 1/4 of the available space each. The third one has 
          two units, so it takes up 2/4 of the available space (or one-half).</p>
        <p>You can also specify a minimum size value inside the flex value. Try updating 
          your existing article rules like so:</p>
        <code>article { <br>
          flex: 1 200px; <br>
        } <br>
        <br>
        article:nth-of-type(3) { <br>
          flex: 2 200px; <br>
        }</code>
        <p>This basically states "Each flex item will first be given 200px of the available 
          space. After that, the rest of the available space will be shared out according 
          to the proportion units." Try refreshing and you'll see a difference in how the 
          space is shared out.</p>
        <img src="img/flex-sample.png" alt="Example of setting the flexible size of flex items">
        <p>The real value of flexbox can be seen in its flexibility/responsiveness — if 
          you resize the browser window, or add another <b>article</b> element, the layout 
          continues to work just fine.</p>
